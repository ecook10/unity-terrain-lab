# Unity Terrain Lab

collection of scripts for generating terrain meshes

## TODO
1. formalize "height functions" - use-cases:
  * shallow around radius for beach island
  * steep in a direction for coastal mountains / cliffs
2. model river / stream erosion (maybe determine path by pre-generated noisy sloping terrain?)
